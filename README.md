## C / C++ WEBSOCKET SERVER FROM SCRATCH

This is my own implementation of websocket server for learning purpose.

Operating System used : Linux Mint 21.1 x86_64

First run another server using python to serve the client webpage:

```
python -m http.server 5173
```

Run the server:

```
./build.sh
```
